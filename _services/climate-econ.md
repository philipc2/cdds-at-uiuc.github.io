# Research questions

## How does climate risk impact the cost of carbon?

Climate-economy integrated assessment models (IAMs) are the state-of-the-art tool policymakers use to assess the benefits and costs of climate policy. Conventional IAMs generally assess the benefits and costs of climate policy within a Ramsey growth framework. However, such models struggle to comprehensively incoroporate risk in their policy recommendations. We're working to use methods from financial asset pricing to directly include risk considerations in climate policy recommendations. Specifically, we built the `Climate Asset Pricing model -- AR6`, a financial asset pricing based IAM (built off [`EZClimate`](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817444116)), with each of its components being in-line with the sixth assessment report issued by the IPCC.
