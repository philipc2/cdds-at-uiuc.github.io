We are interested in formulating conceptual models that explain the fundamental physics of extreme temperature events.

# Main questions

## How does local thermodynamics influence global temperature extremes?
Heat waves cause immense damage to society, and are broadly expected to increase in severity and frequency under climate change. However, a short and non-stationary observational record, along with no consistent pattern of how warming influences temperature extremes in climate models, makes projecting heat wave frequency and intensity into the future difficult. We're focusing on developing a physical model of heat wave physics, rooted in simple surface thermodynamics, that can highlight the key mechanisms underpinning temperature distributions over the land surface.
