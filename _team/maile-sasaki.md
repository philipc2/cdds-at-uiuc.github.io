## Bio 
Maile is a first year Master's student at UIUC. She completed her bachelor's degree in physics at UC Santa Barbara, where she worked on updating a machine learning program that assisted in calibration of resonators in an exoplanet camera and writing an API for the ease of use of a high contrast filter.

While still wanting to continue in programming, her interests diverted to atmospheric and climate sciences. She joined the Climate Dynamics and Data Science group in August 2022 and is collaborating with Dr. Gerard Roe and Becca Stout of the University of Washington in developing a physical-statistical model of Earth's natural climate variability. They will then constrain this model with coral proxy data. Through this, their goal is to help distinguish whether the recent interdecadal variability over the last century is forced or natural. She is also helping write documentation for the ease of use of porting CESM (Community Earth System Models) to Keeling, UIUC's atmospheric sciences high performance computer.

Maile was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico and raised in California's Bay Area. In her free time, she likes to paint and draw surrealist art and sceneries. She enjoys watching horror movies and going on hikes to try and spot subjects for new paintings.
