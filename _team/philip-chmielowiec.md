## Bio
Philip joined CDDS@UIUC as an undergraduate intern in the summer of 2021 and remained a member until he graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in the spring of 2023.

His first project was focussed on setting up and analyzing CESM simulations, investigating the impact that SST and Sea Ice boundary conditions have on climate sensitivity. He also worked on his senior thesis, titled "Investigating the limited sample size of sub-seasonal climate forecasting datasets in deep learning applications"

He is now a full-time Scientific Software Engineer at NSF NCAR, working on the Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team and is pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago.
