## Bio
Rachel is a graduate student in the Department of Atmospheric Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since fall 2021. Her research interests include climate dynamics in models and climate sensitivity. She mainly uses climate model output to understand cloud feedback sources of spread and investigates how the recent cloud feedback pattern responds to the atmospheric environmental changes. 

In her undergraduate years at University of California, San Diego, she did her Bachelor of Science in Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. She worked on organizing ocean properties data while learning the seasonal cycle of Arctic clouds with satellite data as a student researcher. 

Rachel enjoys everything related to food and traveling. She takes pictures of her shoes along the way and keeps a photo log of the places she goes, including her road trips along the west coast and through eastern Canada. Feel free to reach out to chat about clouds, climate, and condiments!
