## Bio
Tyler is a graduate student within the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at UIUC. He joined CDDS@UIUC in 2020 to work on a project related to the effect of ENSO SSTs on atmospheric radiation. He is interested in understanding the physics driving relationships between variables within the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, and how these relationships can be used to enhance climate models. He helps organize the Climate Discussion Group with Adam Bauer and Rachel Tam, and is currently a full-time Physics/Chemistry teacher at the Cherokee Central Schools in North Carolina.

Tyler earned his B.S. in Physics and minor in Mathematics at the University of Missouri in St Louis. At UMSL, he worked on multiple projects within different subdisciplines: he worked on the detection of planetary disks around stars, modeling and observing the release of volatile compounds from comets, and simulating the population dynamics during different phases of a mass extinction event. He’s presented his undergraduate research at UMSL symposiums and the NASA-MO Space Grant Consortium.

Tyler grew up in St Louis, Missouri, met his wife Lidia (who is from Cherokee, North Carolina), and has a beautiful daughter named Magnolia. He enjoys spending time with his family, growing crystals, traveling to the countryside, and cooking.
